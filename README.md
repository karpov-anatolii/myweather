# MyWeather
This is my first app for Android. It was created with React Native/SQLite stack.
The MyWeather app can provide the current weather with forecast (for 5 days with 3 hours gap) for any city on earth. 
You don't need to enter the whole name of city, just 1-2 letters in the input field. The search provides similar cities for your choice.
If you click on "My location weather", you will get the coordinates of you current location and the proper weather.
There is the world's map where the city location is indicated.
Also, all your requests are written in history and can be reviewed.
